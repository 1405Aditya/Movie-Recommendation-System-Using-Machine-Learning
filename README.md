# 📌 **Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application designed to suggest relevant movies to users based on similarity analysis. It leverages movie metadata and user preferences to generate personalized recommendations. The project applies content-based filtering techniques to analyze relationships between movies. Similarity measures are used to identify movies with comparable attributes. This system demonstrates the practical implementation of recommender systems widely used in OTT platforms and digital media services.
